== YubiKey Windows Login
Yubico has created a small utility that can secure access to a Windows computer when used in conjunction with a YubiKey. When properly configured, both the user’s password and YubiKey are required to gain access to the account. When using this tool it is highly recommended to configure a second, back-up YubiKey at the same time in the event access to the primary YubiKey is lost.

=== Required
This guide will show you how to enable a YubiKey to protect your Windows Login. To do so, you will need the following:

 - A local (non-cloud or domain) account on Windows 7 or 8 (32-bit or 64-bit)
 - YubiKey Hardware with firmware 2.2 or later. Should you wish to make a back-up YubiKey (highly recommended), please have another YubiKey available.
 - The YubiKey needs to be configured with our Personalization Tools for HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response with variable input in slot 2.
 - For optimal user experience, we recommend to not have “button press” configured for challenge-response. If button press is configured, please note you will have to press the YubiKey twice when logging in.
 

=== Installation
NOTE: You need to have administrator privileges to be able to install and you need to reboot your computer after the installation.
